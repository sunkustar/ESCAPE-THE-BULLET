# ESCAPE-THE-BULLET
A GAME AUTOMATION USING RL

1. data preprocessing, training: we created game
     first we created a game of single bullet - commit 1- Vanshika
     then we added more bullets and sinks - commit 2-  Vamsi 
     created environment for single bullet using gymnasium - commit 3- Vanshika
     train it on A2C and PPO algorithms using stable-baselines3 - commit 4- Vamsi
     created environment for 5 bullets - commit 5- Vanshika
     train it on A2C and PPO algorithms using stable-baselines3 - commit 6- Vamsi

2. Tasks for final submission:-
	Find a better reward function in case of multiple bullets
	Try some other algorithms
	Change grid shape and some rules
	Train the final model

3. Challenges we are facing:-
	In case of multiple bullets we were unable to train well. We will try running it for longer time to see if we can recieve desirable result.
	Develop a better reward function, tune hyper-parameter.
